# Where we are: read this after README.md, before your handoff

The one page of what's current. Every lead starts from the latest `claude/vigilant-galileo-l6jqyx`. Merge it first and keep your own workflow; this page says what has changed around you. Updated by the main session, 5 October 2026.

## How the team runs now (README has the detail)

- 3 to 5 leads at once. The rest are paused with their handoffs and resumed in turn.
- Heavy work takes turns (`tools/turn.py`): `gpu` (ComfyUI, TRELLIS, MoGe, one at a time), `blender` (two), `godot` (three). A fair queue: ask again within 90 s to keep your place.
- Batch shots and look once. Hand off at about 500k tokens of context. Lean handoffs.
- Before you show the main session anything, run a strict self-critique at 1:1 and send the findings with it.

## The owner's standing decisions (newest first)

- **UI:**
  - Panels over the live world, not full pages ("we like to see our beautiful game").
  - No fades: panels end cleanly, on a ground ever so slightly translucent (about 0.9).
  - No "AI boxes": data is type on the page; stats are a ledger line.
  - Minimal dead space, strict symmetry and grid.
  - Soul through world objects that mean something: the chain (Survivor *Unchained*), coals, the watch-lamp, painted pieces, used sparingly.
  - Toasts, tips and ground labels are stylised type on the world, with no plates.
- **Sound:** CC0 is acceptable (logged in ASSET_PROVENANCE). Our own is best. The owner may send real recordings to `incoming/`.
- **Coverage:** pixel-perfect. Cover exactly what must be covered (the areola, a 2.4 cm midline strip), show everything else, and never a hole or see-through. Her skin under garments is tucked in the shader, not cut. There were never genital issues. Fit means tighter, not bigger.
- **Loot:** fewer, better drops; legendaries (some early) and sets; item level by zone; a filter; slotless stores (pouch, satchel, key ring, belt, purse).
- **Story fights:** small, specialised arenas with ARPG bosses and no endless phase. A loss wakes her at Chid's a day on. Redcowl can be spared or killed. One rise in Act 1; later only via the rise skill.
- **Models:** everything ours over time. The boar is ours (creatures lead). The heroine's and hero's bodies stay. Never Hunyuan3D, free web tools, or real people or others' art. Krea 2 is allowed (US$1M cap).
- **Cinematics:** a cinematic ending in play hands over her exact pose and facing, mid-stride, with the camera easing into play.
- **Animation:** natural, correct motion; be sceptical; sign off per clip.
- **The bar:** "we are striving for perfection". Improved isn't enough.

## Current state by area (handoffs have the detail)

- **Integration:** all tests green (see `dotnet test`).
- **Ready for successors** (handoff pages in docs/handoff/): UI design, UI art, the experience director, combat, animation, crafting, loot (paused), legal (paused), skills VFX (cut off; its work is merged).
- **Running:** the face (v7 and ten preset faces; don't merge the face branch until its art lands).
- **Paused mid-work, to resume in turn:** arena art, creatures (the boar), cinematics, performance, story, the male hero, provenance, voice (paused by the owner: no placeholder voices).
- **Main session:** the heroine's outfits. All four pass the legal motion check. A few sub-6 px slivers in extreme poses wait for the next outfit batch.
