"""Our body sliders (catalogue.json) resolved into MakeHuman macros and targets for mh_base.make_base.

    resolve(spec) -> (macros, targets): the spec's own macros with each slider's macro offsets added (clipped 0..1,
    MPFB then evaluates them as its own nonlinear blends: nothing is linearised here) and the targets each slider
    lays, summed by name (a pair [decr, incr, k]: k |v| on the side of v's sign; "lr": the l- and r- target alike).
A spec with no "sliders" resolves to its own macros and no targets.

    load_spec(path): a spec; one with "base" (a spec's path from the repo) is that spec with its own keys laid over.
